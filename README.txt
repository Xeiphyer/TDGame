Doood, nice work so far! Those fireballs look sick, did you make them or steal them?

Also oh shit that origami crane can move! I need to get through the tutorials, I've been studying all this shit
for my job that starts on monday, I can't fuck up the training or I get fired. I've got like 600 pages of shit in 2 
binders. Its crazy. I'll probably start doing the tutorials monday though, depending on how tough the training is.
