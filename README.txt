Aha, I figured out how to download the files from the server using the GUI finally. 

Doood, nice work so far! Those fireballs look sick, did you make them or steal them?

Also oh shit that origami crane can move! I need to get through the tutorials, I've been studying all this shit for my job that starts on monday, I can't fuck up the training or I get fired. I've got like 600 pages of shit in 2 binders. Its crazy. I'll probably start doing the tutorials monday though, depending on how tough the training is.



Oh, Not sure if you figured this out yet, but with the Git GUI, you can go Repository > Create Desktop Icon, to make a thing that automatically opens Git GUI with the selected folder open and ready to go, its very handy and fast.
Also don't forget to download any changes from the server, its probably better to do them when you start, so you can push without having to merge them first.

I believe its Remote > Fetch From... > origin, and that'll grab the new stuff automatically. If you try and push and you get an error saying something about the head being behind the something something whatever please merge, You gotta download the latest files, then use Local Merge before you can commit and junk.
