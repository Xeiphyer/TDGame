Alright, so the grid is sorta working. All the hard coding we did is sorta fucking everything up though haha.

The range needs to be adjusted for the new tower size, its off center now. Couldn't figure out how to change it.
Also needa make the fireballs spawn from the center of the tower, so we needa get some easy way of getting the center of the sprite. 

Lemme know if you think the tower is too small? We can move the size around pretty easily. Probably need to make it at least twice as big on the selection side.

I added a bar at the top for the life/gold/energy and made the text black, so now its all professional.

Towers won't place in the selection area anymore, but they will still place in the top area with the life and shit I think, I didn't change that yet, though its like a 10second fix.


So, for the grid, I want to get a transparent grid to overlay the map when the tower is selected, and then show the square the tower will place to in a different color, but I think that'll be redundant once we get the sprite to center properly. 
We needa redraw the map to make it fit with the grid better, but that can wait until I make the actual grid appear over the map.
