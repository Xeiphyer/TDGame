I'm not sure you got my email but anyway, check this game out:

I think this is what we should do for sizes, the towers are still 3D too. Once we have the scale it wont matter if we hardcode things in either. once you get the grid going we can set the size of towers and start getting art.

Check my Commit message on the game, its pretty long. Also...

1. Once we get this new stuff finished and have it working so far, we should make a copy of the game so we have a stable version, and the buggy version we are working on. Just in case we mess things up, it'll be easier than trying to remember when the last time everything worked properly was.

2. We are going to have to make sure every tower fits within the same texture area because of the grid. I'm going to make the towers take up 2x2 squares I guess. What's the size of the texture? Scaling and shit is going to make this sort of a headache.
